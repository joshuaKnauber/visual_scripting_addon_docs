# Setup

This will tell you how we recommend developing a package. If you find another way to do it, feel free to do so.

## Project setup

Start by finding the folder where you have installed the visual scripting addon. You can find this in the user preferences in the addons panel under _File_.

In this folder you'll find a folder called nodes. This is the folder you'll work in. When you open up the folder you will find the directories corresponding to the node categories, mentioned in the introduction. These are the installed categories and nodes. When a user installs your package, the zip files content will go in here.

Start by opening the nodes folder in your IDE of choice. We use Visual Studio Code, but you can use whatever you'd like for this.

In the nodes folder you'll find a folder called _base_. This folder holds some of the basic functionality regarding the nodes and node trees. You won't need to pay any attention to this folder. You can't add nodes in here either as it's not a category.

All other folders are existing categories with existing nodes. Here you can add your own nodes.

You should now be able to add nodes as explained below. To reload any changes you make, restart blender.
