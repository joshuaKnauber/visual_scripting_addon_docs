!!! warning " Important!"
    Whatever you do, please **don't report your issue in the ratings of the addon**. That **doesn't help anyone** and is just annoying for us as we really depend on those. It also doesn't help you because **we can't really respond and help you there**. (I wish I didn't have to put this here, but it happens unfortunately)

# Report a bug

Please provide the following information when reporting a bug:

* **A short description of the issue**
* **Node causing the issue**
* **A screenshot of the error message if existing**
* **Addon version**
* **Blender version**
* **Your operating system**
* **List of installed packages (screenshot is fine)**

You can copy the following template and replace the information relevant to your issue. If you think something is absolutely not related to your problem then just don't add it, we will ask you if we think it is. Try to add as much information as you can, that way we can help you the fastest:

```
